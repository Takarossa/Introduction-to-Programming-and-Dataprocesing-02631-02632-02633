Solutions for the exams in Introduction to programming and dataprocessing (02631,02632,02633) at DTU.
I did these for practice and made a test function to make the exam easier. 
I didn't end up using it much because it only works for numeric values, not for arrays and sometimes it's hard to figure out what tests to put in.
Anyway, hope this is useful if you are stuck on a problem. My solutions aren't optimal, just something that works.
